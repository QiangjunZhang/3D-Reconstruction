# About the project

This project code can generate geometries filled with non-overlapping or overlapping objects. The author developed these codes to generate geometries for micro-structures of materials, and use them as input geometries for numerical modelling.

## Examples

  2D Geometry with Non-overlapping Straight Lines.
